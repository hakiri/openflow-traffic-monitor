Administrators are highly interested in monitoring traffic in a network for purposes of collecting statistics, detecting intrusions, and providing forensic evidence. Network size and complexity can make this task highly complex. The main problem exists, how to route the traffic for network analysis in a robust, high performance manner that does not impact normal network traffic. In this project, we propose FlowPusher, a system architecture for directing traffic flow in the network to a monitor node for analysis. This system enables the Network Administrator to do deep packet inspection using third party tools.
